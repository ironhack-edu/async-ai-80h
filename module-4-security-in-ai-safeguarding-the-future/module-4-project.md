## **Project Overview**

In this project, you will analyze a hypothetical AI security breach scenario and propose a detailed mitigation and prevention strategy. This project will help you apply the concepts learned in Module 4, enhancing your skills in identifying vulnerabilities, proposing solutions, and developing long-term security strategies for AI systems.

## **Project Instructions**

1. **Read the Scenario:**

   - Carefully read the hypothetical security breach scenario provided below.
   - Identify the key elements of the breach, including how it occurred and what data or systems were affected.

2. **Identify Vulnerabilities:**

   - List the potential security vulnerabilities that may have led to the breach.
   - Explain how these vulnerabilities could have been exploited by attackers.

3. **Propose Mitigation Strategies:**

   - Develop detailed mitigation strategies to address the identified vulnerabilities.
   - Propose both immediate and long-term measures to enhance the security of the AI system.

4. **Develop a Prevention Plan:**

   - Create a comprehensive prevention plan that includes continuous monitoring, regular audits, and employee training.
   - Outline how the plan will be implemented and maintained over time.

5. **Present Your Findings:**
   - Compile your analysis, mitigation strategies, and prevention plan into a well-organized document.
   - Use clear headings and subheadings to structure your report.

## **Hypothetical AI Security Breach Scenario**

**Scenario:**
A leading e-commerce company uses an AI-powered recommendation system to personalize product suggestions for customers. Recently, the company experienced a significant security breach where attackers gained unauthorized access to the recommendation system's database. Sensitive customer data, including purchase history and personal preferences, was exposed. The breach was not detected for several weeks, allowing the attackers to exfiltrate a large amount of data.

## **Project Steps**

### Step 1: Identify Vulnerabilities

Based on the scenario, identify the potential security vulnerabilities that may have led to the breach. Consider aspects such as data storage, access controls, encryption, and system monitoring.

**Tasks:**

1. List the vulnerabilities that contributed to the breach.
2. Explain how each vulnerability could be exploited by attackers.

### Step 2: Propose Mitigation Strategies

Develop detailed mitigation strategies to address the identified vulnerabilities. Propose both immediate and long-term measures to enhance the security of the AI system.

**Tasks:**

1. Propose solutions to enhance encryption protocols.
2. Suggest measures to improve access controls.
3. Recommend continuous monitoring practices to detect and respond to threats.

### Step 3: Develop a Prevention Plan

Create a comprehensive prevention plan that includes continuous monitoring, regular audits, and employee training. Outline how the plan will be implemented and maintained over time.

**Tasks:**

1. Develop a detailed prevention plan with specific actions and timelines.
2. Include continuous improvement practices to ensure ongoing security.

### Step 4: Present Your Findings

Compile your analysis, mitigation strategies, and prevention plan into a well-organized document. Use clear headings and subheadings to structure your report.

**Tasks:**

1. Write a comprehensive report that includes all your findings.
2. Ensure the report is clear, concise, and well-structured.

## **Submission Instructions**

1. Write your report in a clear and structured format.
2. Create an online document (e.g., Google Docs, Word Online) with your essay.
3. Make sure the link to your online document is set to public or anyone with the link can view.
4. Submit the link to your online document in the provided submission form.
