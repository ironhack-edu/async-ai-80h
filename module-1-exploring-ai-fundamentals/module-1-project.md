### Project: AI Concepts Exercises

### 1. Scenario-Based Questions

Read the following scenarios and answer the questions that follow.

#### Scenario 1: AI in Healthcare

A hospital is implementing an AI system to analyze medical images for early detection of diseases such as cancer. The system uses computer vision to identify abnormalities in X-rays and MRIs.

**Question:** What are the key advantages of using AI in this scenario, and what potential challenges might the hospital face?

#### Scenario 2: AI in Finance

A bank is adopting an AI-based fraud detection system to monitor transactions and flag suspicious activities. The system analyzes patterns in transaction data to identify potential fraud in real-time.

**Question:** How can AI improve fraud detection, and what are the potential risks associated with relying on AI for this task?

### 2. Short Answer Questions

Answer the following questions in a few sentences.

**Question 1:** What was the significance of the Dartmouth Conference in the history of AI?

**Question 2:** How does natural language processing (NLP) differ from computer vision (CV)?

### 3. Fill-in-the-Blanks

Complete the following sentences by filling in the blanks with the correct terms.

1. **AI technologies** such as **\_\_\_\_** and **\_\_\_\_** are transforming industries by enabling machines to understand human language and interpret visual information.
2. The rise of **\_\_\_\_** in the 1980s marked a shift from rule-based systems to data-driven approaches in AI.

3. Combining AI with **\_\_\_\_** can enhance data security and enable new applications such as decentralized AI marketplaces.

4. Autonomous systems, like **\_\_\_\_**, can perform tasks without human intervention, increasing efficiency and reducing costs in various industries.

### 4. Case Studies

Analyze the following case studies and answer the questions.

#### Case Study 1: AI in Entertainment

A streaming service uses AI to recommend content to users based on their viewing history and preferences. The recommendation system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze user data and suggest movies and TV shows.

**Question:** How does AI enhance the user experience in this scenario, and what ethical considerations should be taken into account?

#### Case Study 2: AI in Education

An educational platform uses AI to create personalized learning paths for students. The system analyzes student performance data to adjust the difficulty of lessons and provide targeted support.

**Question:** What are the benefits of using AI in education, and what challenges might educators face in implementing this technology?

### Submission Instructions

1. Create an online document (e.g., Google Docs, Microsoft Word Online) and record your answers to all the questions.
2. Make sure the link to your online document is set to public or anyone with the link can view.
3. Ensure your document is well-organized, with each question and answer clearly labeled.
4. Submit the link to your online document in the provided submission form.
