## **Hands-On Exercise: Data Cleaning, Processing, and Visualization**

### Step-by-Step Guide to Using ChatGPT for Data Analysis

### Using ChatGPT for Data Cleaning

1. **Inspect the Dataset:**

   - Open the `customer_segmentation.csv` file and take a look at the columns and data it contains.
   - Note any initial observations about the data quality.

2. **Upload the Dataset to ChatGPT:**

   - Use ChatGPT's file upload feature to upload the `customer_segmentation.csv` file.

3. **Identify Missing Values:**

   - Ask ChatGPT to identify missing values in the dataset. Use the prompt: "Identify missing values in the dataset."
   - ChatGPT will analyze the dataset and highlight columns with missing values.

4. **Handle Missing Data:**

   - For "CustomerID" and "Description" columns, ask ChatGPT to handle missing data appropriately. Use the prompt: "Handle missing data by removing rows with missing 'CustomerID' and replacing missing 'Description' with 'No Description'."
   - ChatGPT will process the dataset and handle missing values accordingly.

5. **Document Your Findings:**
   - Write down the columns that had missing values and how ChatGPT handled them.

### Using ChatGPT for Data Processing

1. **Feature Selection:**

   - Ask ChatGPT to select important features for analysis. Use the prompt: "Select important features from the dataset for further analysis."
   - ChatGPT will provide a list of important features based on the dataset.

2. **Specify the Type of Analysis:**

   - Specify the type of analysis you want to perform and on which columns. For example, "Perform a correlation analysis on the 'Quantity' and 'UnitPrice' columns."

3. **Document Your Findings:**
   - Write down the steps ChatGPT took to select important features and why those features were chosen.

### Using ChatGPT for Data Summarization

1. **Generate Summary Statistics:**

   - Ask ChatGPT to generate summary statistics. Use the prompt: "Generate summary statistics for the dataset."
   - ChatGPT will provide summary statistics for each column.

2. **Identify Trends or Patterns:**

   - Ask ChatGPT to identify trends or patterns. Use the prompt: "Identify trends or patterns in the dataset."
   - ChatGPT will analyze the dataset and highlight significant trends or patterns.

3. **Document Your Findings:**
   - Write down the key statistics and any trends or patterns identified by ChatGPT.

### Creating Visualizations

1. **Generate Visualizations:**

   - Ask ChatGPT to generate visualizations. Use the prompt: "Create visualizations to represent the data insights."
   - ChatGPT will provide visualizations based on the dataset, such as bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots.

2. **Document Your Findings:**
   - Include the visualizations in your report and write a brief description of what each visualization represents.

### Example Workflow/Prompts:

1. **Upload the Dataset:**

   - "Here is the dataset 'customer_segmentation.csv'."

2. **Identify Missing Values:**

   - "Identify missing values in the dataset."

3. **Handle Missing Data:**

   - "Handle missing data by removing rows with missing 'CustomerID' and replacing missing 'Description' with 'No Description'."

4. **Select Important Features:**

   - "Select important features from the dataset for further analysis."

5. **Perform Analysis:**

   - "Perform a correlation analysis on the 'Quantity' and 'UnitPrice' columns."

6. **Generate Summary Statistics:**

   - "Generate summary statistics for the dataset."

7. **Identify Trends or Patterns:**

   - "Identify trends or patterns in the dataset."

8. **Generate Visualizations:**
   - "Create visualizations to represent the data insights."

### Creating a Report

1. **Compile Your Notes:**

   - Compile all the notes you have taken during the lab into a Google Doc.
   - Include the steps ChatGPT took for data cleaning, processing, and summarization.

2. **Include Visualizations:**

   - Paste the visualizations provided by ChatGPT into the Google Doc.
   - Write a brief description for each visualization, explaining the insights gained.

3. **Answer the Following Questions in Your Report:**
   - What were the main issues found in the initial dataset?
   - How did ChatGPT handle missing data and why was that method chosen?
   - What trends or patterns did ChatGPT identify in the data?
   - How do the visualizations help in understanding the data better?

### Submission Instructions

- Save your Google Doc with the title "Lab_Data_Analysis_YourName".
- Make sure the link to your online document is set to public or anyone with the link can view.
- Submit the link to your online document in the provided submission form.
