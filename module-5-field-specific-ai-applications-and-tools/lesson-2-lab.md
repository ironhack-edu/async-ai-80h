## **Lab Overview**

In this lab, you will use Figma, a powerful design tool, to create a simple user interface (UI). You will use AI plugins to enhance your design capabilities by automating repetitive tasks and suggesting design improvements. You will be guided through the process of designing a UI and personalizing it using AI features.

## **Lab Objectives**

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Utilize Figma to create a UI.
- Integrate AI plugins to enhance design functionality.
- Personalize UI design using AI plugins.

## **Setting Up the Lab Environment**

### Instructions for Accessing and Using Figma

1. **Sign Up for Figma:**

   - Go to [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).
   - Click on "Sign up" to create a free account.
   - Follow the instructions to complete the registration process.

2. **Explore Figma:**

   - Once logged in, you will see your dashboard. Click on "Design File" to create a new project.
   - Familiarize yourself with the interface, focusing on the toolbar on the left, the properties panel on the right, and the main workspace in the center.

3. **Install AI Plugins:**

## **Hands-On Exercise: Creating a UI Design**

### Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Simple Login Page

1. **Open Figma:**

   - Log in to your Figma account.
   - Click on "Design File" to create a new project.

2. **Set Up Your Workspace:**

   - Click on the "Frame Tool" (press F on your keyboard).
   - In the properties panel on the right, choose a preset frame size such as "Desktop" or "Mobile".
   - Click and drag to create a frame on your canvas.

3. **Design the Login Page Layout:**
   - **Title:**
     - Click on the "Text Tool" (press T on your keyboard).
     - Click on the frame and type "Login".
     - Adjust the font size and position the title at the top center of the frame.
   - **Username Label and Box:**
     - Use the Text Tool to create a label "Username:".
     - Position the label below the title.
     - Use the "Rectangle Tool" (press R on your keyboard) to draw a box next to the label for the username input field.
   - **Password Label and Box:**
     - Repeat the above steps to create a label "Password:" and a corresponding box for the password input field, positioned below the username field.
   - **Login Button:**
     - Use the Rectangle Tool to draw a button below the password field.
     - Use the Text Tool to add the text "Login" inside the button.
     - Adjust the button's size and color as desired.

### Personalizing the Design Using AI Plugins

1. **Generating Avatars with UI Faces:**

   - Select a placeholder image where you want the avatar to be.
   - Right-click and choose "Plugins" > "UI Faces".
   - In the UI Faces plugin window, select the desired settings and click "Apply Faces" to generate an avatar.
   - Position the avatar image next to the username input field to represent the user's profile picture.

2. **Automatically Name Layers:**
   - Select the layers you have created by holding down Shift and clicking on each element.
   - Right-click and choose "Plugins" > "Autoname".
   - The plugin will rename your layers based on their content, making your design more organized.

### Finalizing the Design

1. **Review and Adjust:**

   - Check your design for consistency and alignment by zooming in and out (Ctrl + Scroll Wheel) and moving elements around to ensure proper spacing.
   - Make necessary adjustments to improve the overall look and feel by selecting elements and editing their properties.

2. **Test the Design:**
   - Click on the "Prototype" tab in the properties panel on the right.
   - Click and drag the blue circle on the "Login" button to simulate the interaction, linking it to another frame or element if needed.
   - Press "Play" in the top right corner to preview your prototype.

## **Submission Instructions**

### Guidelines for Submitting the Lab

1. **Take a Screenshot:**

   - Once your design is complete, press "Print Screen" (PrtSc) on your keyboard to capture a screenshot of your final UI.
   - Open a Google Doc and paste the screenshot (Ctrl + V).

2. **Create a Google Doc:**

   - Add a brief description of your design, highlighting how you used the AI plugins to enhance it.
   - Save the document with the title "Lab_UI_Design_YourName".

3. **Submit the Google Doc:**
   - Make sure the link to your online document is set to public or anyone with the link can view.
