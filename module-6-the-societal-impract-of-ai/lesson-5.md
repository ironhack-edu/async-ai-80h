## **Reflecting on Ethical Responsibilities**

As an AI developer, you hold a significant role in shaping the technology that influences society. It is crucial to reflect on your ethical responsibilities to ensure that your work contributes positively to the world.

### Personal Reflection on the Ethical Role of AI Developers

Reflecting on your role as an AI developer involves considering the potential impacts of your work on individuals and society. Think about the following questions:

- How does your work affect people's lives?
- What are the potential positive and negative consequences of your AI projects?
- How can you ensure that your work aligns with ethical principles and contributes positively to society?

### Case Studies Highlighting Ethical Dilemmas in AI Development

Examining real-world case studies can provide valuable insights into the ethical dilemmas faced by AI developers. Let's explore a couple of notable examples:

1. **Facial Recognition Technology:**
