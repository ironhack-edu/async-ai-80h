## **Project Overview**

Welcome to the Module 6 Project! In this project, you will apply your understanding of ethical responsibilities in AI by creating an engaging and interactive scenario. You will develop a story-based scenario involving AI, highlighting ethical dilemmas, potential societal impacts, and proposing solutions. This creative approach will help you think critically about the ethical considerations in AI development and usage.

## **Project Objectives**

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Reflect on the ethical responsibilities of AI developers and users.
- Identify potential ethical dilemmas and societal impacts of AI.
- Propose solutions to address ethical issues in AI.
- Demonstrate your understanding of ethical principles through a creative and interactive scenario.

## **Project Instructions**

### **Creating an Ethical AI Scenario**

1. **Choose a Theme:**

   - Select a theme for your scenario that involves AI. Possible themes include healthcare, finance, education, social media, or autonomous vehicles.

2. **Develop the Scenario:**

   - Create a story-based scenario that involves an AI application within your chosen theme.
   - Identify at least two ethical dilemmas faced by the characters in your story.
   - Highlight the potential societal impacts of the AI application.

3. **Introduce the Characters:**

   - Develop characters who interact with the AI application. These can include AI developers, users, policymakers, or affected individuals.
   - Provide a brief background for each character to give context to their actions and decisions.

4. **Present the Ethical Dilemmas:**

   - Describe the ethical dilemmas your characters face. These should be situations where the ethical responsibilities of AI development and usage are questioned.
   - Explain the potential consequences of each dilemma.

5. **Propose Solutions:**

   - Propose solutions to address the ethical dilemmas. These should include strategies for ethical AI development, such as transparency, fairness, accountability, and inclusivity.
   - Discuss how these solutions can minimize negative societal impacts.

6. **Interactive Elements:**
   - Include interactive elements in your scenario to engage the reader. For example, pose questions at key points in the story, asking the reader to decide what the characters should do next.
   - Provide multiple-choice options for each decision point and explain the potential outcomes of each choice.

### **Example Scenario Outline**

**Theme: Healthcare**

**Title: The Ethical AI in Healthcare**

**Characters:**

- **Dr. Smith:** AI developer working on an AI diagnostic tool.
- **Anna:** A patient using the AI tool for a diagnosis.
- **Mr. Johnson:** Hospital administrator concerned about data privacy.
- **Jane:** A data privacy advocate.

**Scenario:**

1. **Introduction:**

   - Dr. Smith develops an AI diagnostic tool to assist doctors in diagnosing diseases.
   - Anna uses the tool for a diagnosis but is concerned about how her data is used.

2. **Ethical Dilemmas:**

   - **Dilemma 1:** The AI tool misdiagnoses a condition, raising questions about the reliability of AI in critical healthcare decisions.
   - **Dilemma 2:** The hospital wants to use patient data to improve the AI tool but faces privacy concerns from patients and advocates.

3. **Interactive Decision Points:**

   - **Decision 1:** Should Dr. Smith prioritize improving the AI tool's accuracy or ensure full transparency with patients about its limitations?
     - **Option A:** Prioritize accuracy.
     - **Option B:** Ensure transparency.
   - **Decision 2:** Should the hospital use patient data to enhance the AI tool, considering the privacy concerns?
     - **Option A:** Use the data with strict privacy safeguards.
     - **Option B:** Seek explicit consent from each patient before using their data.

4. **Proposed Solutions:**
   - Dr. Smith and the hospital decide to implement rigorous testing and validation processes to improve the AI tool's accuracy.
   - The hospital adopts a policy of full transparency with patients, informing them of the AI tool's capabilities and limitations.
   - They establish strict data privacy safeguards and seek explicit consent from patients before using their data for AI improvements.

### **Guidelines for Creating the Scenario**

- **Length:** Your scenario should be 800-1000 words.
- **Format:** Use a clear and organized structure with an introduction, character descriptions, ethical dilemmas, decision points, and proposed solutions.
- **Interactivity:** Include at least two decision points with multiple-choice options.
- **Clarity:** Ensure your scenario is clear, concise, and free of grammatical errors.
- **Originality:** Reflect your own thoughts and perspectives while incorporating insights from the lessons and additional research.

### **Submission Instructions**

1. Write your ethical AI scenario following the guidelines provided.
2. Create an online document (e.g., Google Docs, Microsoft Word Online) with your scenario.
3. Save your report as "Module 6 Project_YourName".
4. Make sure the link to your online document is set to public or anyone with the link can view.
5. Submit the link to your online document in the provided submission form.
